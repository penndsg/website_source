This project is based on the Kaggle competition titled [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). This is an ongoing learning competition based on the classic Titanic dataset, which contains information on all of the passengers of the Titanic, including whether or not they survived. This is a great project for beginners since there are detailed tutorials to introduce machine learning techniques in a straighforward way.
