This project is based on the Kaggle competition titled [Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer). This is an ongoing learning competition based on the classic MNIST dataset of images of handwritten digits. Since this dataset has been so extensively studied, many useful scripts and resources are available. This makes it a great option for easing into image-based machine learning.
