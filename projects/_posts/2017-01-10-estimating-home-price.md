title: Estimating Home Values from Nearby School Profiles
current: true
---

This project is inspired by Zillow's machine learning methods to <a href="http://www.zillow.com/zestimate/">estimate</a> home values.
It is commonly known that the quality of school districts is positively correlated with the neighborhood value.
This project intends to capture the trend quantitatively using Zillow's <a href="http://www.zillow.com/howto/api/APIOverview.htm">API</a> and Great School's <a href="https://www.greatschools.org/api/registration.page">API</a>.
