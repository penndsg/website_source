This project is based on the Kaggle competition titled [Facebook V: Predicting Check Ins](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-v-predicting-check-ins). This competition is already complete, but teams can still create create submissions and see how well different models score compared to everyone else. From the competition description on Kaggle:

> The goal of this competition is to predict which place a person would like to check in to. For the purposes of this competition, Facebook created an artificial world consisting of more than 100,000 places located in a 10 km by 10 km square. For a given set of coordinates, your task is to return a ranked list of the most likely places. Data was fabricated to resemble location signals coming from mobile devices, giving you a flavor of what it takes to work with real data complicated by inaccurate and noisy values. Inconsistent and erroneous location data can disrupt experience for services like Facebook Check In.
