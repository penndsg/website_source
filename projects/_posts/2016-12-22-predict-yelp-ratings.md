title: Predicting Yelp Review Ratings from Review Text
current: true
---

This project is based on Round 8 of the [Yelp Dataset Challenge](https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge), for which Yelp generously provides their data on local businesses in Edinburgh, Karlsruhe, Montreal, Waterloo, Pittsburgh, Charlotte, Urbana-Champaign, Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Madison. For this project, we'll attempt to use the text data from 2.7 million reviews to predict the rating of any given review.
