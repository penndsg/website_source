This project is based on the Kaggle competition titled [Shelter Anmial Outcomes](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes). This competition is already complete, but teams can still create create submissions and see how well different models score compared to everyone else. From the competition description on Kaggle:

> Using a dataset of intake information including breed, color, sex, and age from the [Austin Animal Center](http://www.austintexas.gov/department/aac), we're asking Kagglers to predict the outcome for each animal.
>
> We also believe this dataset can help us understand trends in animal outcomes. These insights could help shelters focus their energy on specific animals who need a little extra help finding a new home. We encourage you to publish your insights on [Scripts](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes/kernels) so they are publicly accessible.
