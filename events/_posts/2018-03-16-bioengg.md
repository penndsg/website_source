description: 'Come and hear Dr. Himes and Dr. Himmelstein for a talk on Data Science in Bioengineering'
---
<a href="http://dhimmel.com/">Dr. Daniel Himmelstein</a> will be speaking on 'Liberating Academia: Parables of Open Data'.<br>
<a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8789288">Dr. Blanca Himes</a> will be talking about 'Data Science in Medicine'.<br>

Various efforts are underway to gather a wide range of
patient-specific data, including symptoms, medication utilization, environmental exposures, and genomics, with the expectation that collection and integration of this data will enable personalized medicine. This talk will illustrate different contexts in which data scientists are needed in medicine, including the analysis of electronic-health record (EHR)-derived data and the analysis of omic data.

Pizza will be served.
