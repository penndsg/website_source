I am an undergraduate in the [Networked and Social Systems Engineering](http://www.nets.upenn.edu/) program as well as a submatriculant in the new [Master's program in Data Science](https://dats.seas.upenn.edu/) at Penn.
Some of my professional interests include network science, distributed computing, machine learning and their applications to businesses, telecommunications, and defense. I am excited to meet new people, collaborate on projects, and learn with PDSG.
