I am an undergraduate student at the University of Pennsylvania’s Networked and Social Systems Engineering (NETS) Program.  Some of my professional interests include distributed computing, machine learning and their applications to businesses, telecommunications, and defense.  I’m excited to meet new people, collaborate on projects, and learn with PDSG.
