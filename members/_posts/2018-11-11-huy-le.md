I am an MBA/ MA in International Studies at Wharton/ UPenn. I am interested in advanced analytics tools at the intersection of customer analytics, artificial intelligence and computational neuroscience. As someone with minimal statistics and computer science training before joining UPenn, I aspire to contribute to the efforts that make data science more accessible to the broader UPenn community.
