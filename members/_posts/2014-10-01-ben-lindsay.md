I am a PhD student in the Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering department,
and I'm am also coadvised by [Russ Composto](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~polymer/)
in the Materials Science and Engineering department.
I use polymer field theory simulations to probe interactions
between nanoparticles and polymer matrices
to complement experimental work in the Composto lab.

I received my bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering
from [Brigham Young University](https://chemicalengineering.byu.edu/).
I developed an interest in molecular modeling
as a research assistant for [Thomas Knotts](http://knotts.byu.edu/),
where I used coarse-grain molecular dynamics simulations
to study interactions between free DNA strands and DNA strands bound to a surface.
