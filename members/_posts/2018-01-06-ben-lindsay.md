I am a PhD student in the [Riggleman Computational Soft Matter Lab](http://rrgroup.seas.upenn.edu/). During the course of my research, I developed a love of learning new tools and techniques for data analysis and visualization. I started this group with [Jennifer Hwang](/members/jennifer-hwang/) to make it easier for others like us to learn from and teach each other industrially relevant data science skills.
