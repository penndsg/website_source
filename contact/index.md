## Slack

We have a growing community of data-oriented students on Slack. Anyone with a UPenn email address can join our community by following [this link](https://join.slack.com/t/pdsg/signup/). Our Slack community is a great place to meet other students with similar interests, get technical help, and get career advice. You can talk about whatever you want here, as long as you are respectful of others. You can contact specific board members or all group members on Slack.

## Email

If you don't feel like using Slack, feel free to send us an email any time. You can send an email to all the executive board members using [board@penndsg.com](mailto:board@penndsg.com). Whoever is most relevant to the email will respond as soon as he or she can. Otherwise, you could check out the [members](/members/) page and email anyone individually if you know who you want to talk to.
